Smart Safety and Surveillance System
A  safety monitoring solution that integrates accident detection, helmet detection, fall detection, and crowd detection using computer vision and deep learning. This system is designed to enhance workplace and public safety by continuously analyzing live video feeds and sending instant alerts when critical incidents are detected.

Features
Accident Detection – Identifies unusual and potentially dangerous incidents in monitored areas.
Helmet Detection – Detects whether individuals are wearing helmets, ensuring compliance with safety protocols.
Fall Detection – Uses pose estimation to recognize when a person has fallen, enabling quick emergency response.
Crowd Detection – Monitors crowding levels to prevent overcrowding and potential hazards.
Real-Time Alerts – Instantly notifies stakeholders when safety violations or emergencies are detected.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks & Libraries:
TensorFlow / PyTorch (Deep Learning Models)
OpenCV (Computer Vision)
YOLO / CNNs (Object Detection)
Pose Estimation Models (e.g., OpenPose / MediaPipe)
Deployment: Local/Edge device support for real-time monitoring

How It Works
Live Video Feed Input – The system processes real-time video streams from cameras.
Detection Pipeline – Uses object detection (YOLO/CNN) and pose estimation for identifying events and safety violations.
Event Classification – Differentiates between normal and critical events (accidents, falls, overcrowding, missing helmets).
Alerting System – Sends instant notifications when critical incidents occur.

Future Enhancements
Integration with IoT devices for automated response (e.g., alarms).
Dashboard for live monitoring and analytics.
Cloud deployment for scalable multi-location surveillance.
